# 🔐 Encryption Lab Report  

This repository contains my Encryption Lab Report, where I explored AES encryption, decryption, and data integrity verification using OpenSSL in Kali Linux.  

## 📌 Overview  
- Implemented AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 encryption.  
- Used both password-based and key-based encryption with IVs.  
- Applied HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) for data integrity verification.  
- Strengthened knowledge of cryptographic best practices in cybersecurity.
